# Wallet Payment Integration Setup

## Overview
The application now supports real wallet payments for unlocking divination interpretations. Users can connect their wallets and pay with ETH to unlock detailed readings.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Wallet Connection
- **WalletProvider**: Configured with wagmi to support multiple chains (Mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base)
- **WalletButton**: Allows users to connect/disconnect MetaMask and other injected wallets
- **Location**: Navigation header and payment page

### 2. Payment Processing
- **PaymentHandler Component**: Handles real blockchain transactions
- **Supported Currencies**: Currently ETH (SOL and APT marked as "Coming Soon")
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Waits for blockchain confirmation before proceeding

### 3. Payment Flow
1. User selects amount (preset: 0.001, 0.005, 0.01 ETH or custom amount)
2. User connects wallet via WalletButton
3. User clicks payment button to initiate transaction
4. Transaction is sent to blockchain
5. System waits for confirmation
6. User is redirected to interpretation page with transaction hash

## Configuration Required

### 1. Update Payment Address
In `/frontend/components/PaymentHandler.js`, replace the ETH address:

```javascript
const PAYMENT_ADDRESSES = {
  ETH: '0x29E8e6d80446A1b59309c9099cc5515f721a9049', // Replace this
  SOL: '9pSuRtzVWbSHzCwAMdmT12BZGLK6pFv9hURxDrgACEXr, // For future SOL integration
  APT: '0x1', // For future APT integration
}
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Optional)
You can set up environment variables for better security:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_ETH_ADDRESS=your_eth_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SOL_ADDRESS=your_sol_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_APT_ADDRESS=your_apt_address
```

## Testing

### 1. Local Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to divination flow: Home → Divination → Continue through steps
3. On payment page (suangua5), connect wallet and test payment

### 2. Testnet Testing
- The wagmi configuration supports mainnet and testnets
- For testing, consider deploying to a testnet like Sepolia
- Update the chain configuration in `/frontend/lib/wagmi.js` if needed

## Security Considerations

1. **Payment Address**: Ensure you control the receiving address
2. **Amount Validation**: The system validates positive amounts
3. **Transaction Verification**: Waits for blockchain confirmation
4. **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **SOL Integration**: Requires Solana wallet adapter (@solana/wallet-adapter-react)
2. **APT Integration**: Requires Aptos wallet integration
3. **Payment History**: Store and display user payment history
4. **Subscription Model**: Implement recurring payments
5. **Multi-currency Rates**: Add real-time exchange rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Connect Wallet First"**: User needs to connect wallet before payment
2. **"ETH Only (For Now)"**: Other currencies are not yet implemented
3. **Transaction Failed**: Check network connection and wallet balance
4. **Slow Confirmation**: Ethereum transactions can take time, especially during network congestion

### Files Modified:

# 🔧 Wallet Debug Guide

## Current Status
The `wallet.request is not a function` error has been addressed with multiple fallback methods.

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Open Browser Console**: Press F12 → Console tab
2. **Navigate to Payment Page**: Go through divination flow to reach payment
3. **Connect Wallet**: Use Privy to connect (email or existing wallet)
4. **Check Debug Info**: Look at top-right debug panel
5. **Attempt Payment**: Try to pay 0.001 ETH
6. **Check Console**: Look for these debug messages:

```
Wallet info: { address: "0x...", type: "...", connectorType: "..." }
Sending transaction: { to: "0x...", value: "0x...", from: "0x..." }
Provider obtained: true/false
Transaction sent: 0x...
```

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**

The updated PrivyPaymentHandler now tries multiple methods:

1. **Primary**: `wallet.getEthereumProvider().request()`
2. **Fallback 1**: `wallet.sendTransaction()` 
3. **Fallback 2**: `wallet.request()`
4. **Error**: Clear error message about available methods

## 💡 **Expected Behavior:**

- **Email Users**: Should get embedded wallet → provider method works
- **MetaMask Users**: Should use external provider → provider method works  
- **Console Logs**: Should show which method succeeded
- **Error Messages**: More descriptive if all methods fail

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. Test with different login methods (email vs wallet)
2. Check console for wallet type and available methods
3. Report which method works for your setup
4. If still failing, we'll add more debugging

## 📝 **Common Wallet Types:**

- `privy` - Embedded Privy wallet
- `injected` - MetaMask/Browser wallet  
- `walletConnect` - WalletConnect wallets
- `coinbaseWallet` - Coinbase Wallet

Ready to test! The payment should work now with the improved fallback methods. 🎯
